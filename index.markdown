This year in Android Academy is very different:
we're online, spread out across different locations, working and learning from our homes.
Now we have to concentrate on beeing engaged, active, and curious.

To bring you more awareness about what your engagement is and how you can do better, we introduced a brand new Achievement system with
[students rating](/rating).
I'm sure you've already played computer games with achievements and familiar with this kind of system in general: whenever you do something great, you get a special trophy and points to your total score. Based on that score we build ratings of all our students.

So what exactly should I do to get an achievement?
[Submit your homework](/achievements/homework_completed_1/)
before the due date,
don't ever stop to
[make a strike](/achievements/homework_completed_5/).
[Help other students](/achievements/helping_hand)
in Android Academy's chats, and say 
[thank you](https://forms.gle/bkXV6ZvfF7isFDpZ8)
when you get help.
[Visit workshops](/achievements/attended_workshop),
leave feedback to let us know that you've been there,
make the learning process better 
[highlighting what can be improved](/achievements/critic).
