- question: I filled up feedback form but haven't got achievement for workshop attending. What can I do?
  answer: >
    <ol>
      <li>Wait for at least an hour. Achievement system updates data with 1 hour interval.</li>
      <li>Make sure that you specified correct telegram name. If you see <a href="/assets/telegram-name-example.jpg" target="_blank">that</a> in the settings, telegram name in form should be @VadzimV. If name is wrong, please fill-up form again.</li>
